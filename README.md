# 3D Lunar Lander
A physics-driven 3D Lunar Lander game developed in C++ with OpenFrameworks for CS 134 at San Jose State University taught by Professor Kevin Smith.

Navigate a spacecraft through a simulation of the moon and reach the goal.
## Features  
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic thrust, gravity, and turbulence forces.
- **Collision Detection**: Ray-based altitude telemetry and impulse-based terrain collision resolution.
- **Particle Effects**: Shader-rendered rocket exhaust and explosion/landing effects.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Multi-source lighting and toggleable spacecraft light.
- **Camera Views**: Multiple perspectives including tracking, onboard, and default fixed camera.  
- **Immersive Sound**: Background music and spacecraft sound effects.  
- **Trailer**: A gameplay showcase highlighting key features.
